# KGNINJA Thinking Method (Privacy-Safe / Simple)

## 0. North Star (Top Principles)
- **Break assumptions**: Question “obvious truths” and replace them with alternative definitions.
- **Prototype first**: Prefer a working demo over theory to maximize learning speed.
- **Monetization-aware**: Do not stop at “it works”; connect to market feedback and a revenue path early.

## 1. Problem Framing (Who / What pain / How to measure)
- Clarify **who** it’s for, **what hurts**, and **how success is measured**.
- Do not accept requirements verbatim—**re-define them using metaphors or alternate wording** to reach the same goal via a better route.

## 2. Two-Layer Design: Truth vs. Experience
- **Truth Layer**: Verifiable (metrics, logs, reproducible steps, evidence).
- **Experience Layer**: Feels correct and usable (UI, wording, narrative).
- You may enhance Experience, but **never damage Truth** (order: Truth → Experience).

## 3. Build Pattern (Shortest loop)
- Minimize inputs (rule of thumb: **≤ 3 key inputs**).
- Standardize outputs with **fixed formats** (Markdown / JSON / CSV).
- Always embed an **evaluation hook** (metrics, checklist, automated scoring).
- Limit side effects; keep everything traceable (logs, history, diffs).

## 4. Reproducibility and Knowledge Transfer
- Preserve **logs / steps / templates** so others can reproduce it.
- “Built” is not the finish line—run an improvement loop (evaluate → revise → re-evaluate).

## 5. AI-Native System Design (AI-Connection Optimized)
- Optimize structure first (naming conventions, folders, README, templates) so AI can operate safely and efficiently.
- Keep human intuition as the core; use AI as an **accelerator** (validation, formatting, iteration).

## 6. Communication Strategy
- Even if the internals are advanced, keep the surface **catchy** (easy entry, deep depth).
- Design deliverables and messaging for **fast comprehension**.
